BERTopic and Causal Discovery Analysis on Mental Health Dataset: Exploring Factors Affecting Mental Health Issues

### Project Summary

- **Goal**
    - Understanding how specific topics are related to mental health issues.
- **Background**
    - BERTopic was applied to the text data, and the resulting topic probabilities were then used to perform causal discovery analysis on the dependent variable, which is the mental health label.
- **Dataset**
    - “Mental Health Dataset” retrieved from Kaggle.
- **Results**
    - The analysis revealed that Topic_0, focusing on emotions and thoughts, had a significant dual effect on mental health, both increasing and alleviating concerns. Topic 1, related to "Film and Entertainment," showed a notable impact in reducing mental health issues through escapism, but also had a moderate positive effect, indicating a complex relationship. Other topics had minimal effects. These findings highlight the nuanced impact of different topics on mental well-being.
